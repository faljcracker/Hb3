                                countries simply require the veterinarian who examines your pet to be licensed in the
                                state of origin, and no USDA endorsement of the veterinarian’s examination statement is
                                required. Some countries will accept a standard letterhead health certificate and rabies
                                certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian and endorsed by the USDA. However, other
                                countries may require that your pet be checked by a federally-accredited veterinarian
                                and that a United States Interstate and International Certificate for Health Examination
                                for Small Animals (APHIS Form 7001) be issued by that veterinarian and endorsed by the
                                USDA.(Since August 1994 only a federally accredited veterinarian can sign this form.)
                                Carefully check the OBC country briefing box or call the embassy to determine the exact
                                requirements before making an appointment with a veterinarian. Also check the airline
                                you will be using for your pet. There have been cases where a country does not require a
                                certification, but a particular airline does. There is a USDA endorsement fee per
                                certificate for cats and dogs. Contact the USDA-APHIS for the current cost of the
                                endorsement of the APHIS-7001 form. Note: More than one dog or cat may be on a
                                certificate. For other animals, call the USDA at the numbers below.</p>

                                or when they are seeking employment in an international legal context. Similarly,

                                inactive (grace period), or inactive. It is the CIA’s responsibility to assure that the

                                Certification Board (PCB). CPE reporting forms are submitted by CIAs on an annual basis
                                (no later than December 31 each year) and serve as signed statements that all applicable
                                CPE requirements have been met.</p>
